# Learning Programming with Sachin

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository contains basic programs written as I learn programming fundamentals using the Sachin programming language - a unique language designed for exploring both procedural and parallel programming concepts.

## What is Sachin?

Sachin is an educational programming language created for learning programming concepts, with built-in support for parallel programming. It features:

- **Strong type checking** - No mixing of types (booleans, integers, channels)
- **Clear syntax** - Easy to read and understand for beginners
- **Parallel programming support** - Learn concurrent programming naturally
- **Array bounds checking** - Prevents common programming errors
- **Multiple assignment** - Elegant syntax like `a, b = c, d`

The language is named after cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar! üèè

## My Learning Journey

This repository serves as a collection of programs I'm writing while learning programming fundamentals. Each program represents a step forward in understanding different concepts - from basic input/output and loops to more advanced topics like recursion and parallel programming.

**Programs will be added here as I progress through my learning journey.** Check back regularly to see new examples and solutions to various programming challenges!

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need the Sachin compiler and runtime:

1. Download the Sachin compiler from the [main repository](https://github.com/chittur/parallel-programming-language)
2. Build the Visual Studio solution
3. Run programs using: `Sachin.exe execute <program-file.txt>`

## What You'll Find Here

As I continue learning, this repository will grow to include programs covering:

- **Basic concepts**: Variables, input/output, conditionals
- **Control structures**: Loops, decision making
- **Functions**: Parameter passing, recursion
- **Data structures**: Arrays, basic algorithms
- **Parallel programming**: Channels, concurrent execution
- **Practice problems**: Solutions to common programming challenges

## Language Basics

Here's a quick taste of Sachin syntax:

```sachin
$ This is a comment
{
  integer number;
  boolean found = false;
  
  read number;
  write "You entered:", number;
  
  if (number > 0)
  {
    write "Positive number!";
  }
}
```
